# Day 01

## Exercise 00
write a SQL statement which returns menu’s identifier and pizza names from `menu` table and person’s identifier and person name from `person` table in one global list (with column names as presented on a sample below) ordered by object_id and then by object_name columns.

| object_id | object_name |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | Anna |
| 1 | cheese pizza |
| ... | ... |


## Exercise 01
modify a SQL statement from “exercise 00” by removing the object_id column. Then change ordering by object_name for part of data from the `person` table and then from `menu` table (like presented on a sample below). save duplicates!

| object_name |
| ------ |
| Andrey |
| Anna |
| ... |
| cheese pizza |
| cheese pizza |
| ... |


## Exercise 02
write a SQL statement which returns unique pizza names from the `menu` table and orders by pizza_name column in descending mode. `DISTINCT`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING` and any type of `JOINs` are forbidden.                                        

## Exercise 03
write a SQL statement which returns common rows for attributes order_date, person_id from `person_order` table from one side and visit_date, person_id from `person_visits` table from the other side (please see a sample below). In other words, let’s find identifiers of persons, who visited and ordered some pizza on the same day. Add ordering by action_date in ascending mode and then by person_id in descending mode. any type of `JOINs` are forbidden.

| action_date | person_id |
| ------ | ------ |
| 2022-01-01 | 6 |
| 2022-01-01 | 2 |
| 2022-01-01 | 1 |
| 2022-01-03 | 7 |
| 2022-01-04 | 3 |
| ... | ... |


## Exercise 04
write a SQL statement which returns a difference (minus) of person_id column values with saving duplicates between `person_order` table and `person_visits` table for order_date and visit_date are for 7th of January of 2022. Any type of `JOINs` are forbidden.


## Exercise 05
write a SQL statement which returns all possible combinations between `person` and `pizzeria` tables and please set ordering by person identifier and then by pizzeria identifier columns. take a look at the result sample below.

| person.id | person.name | age | gender | address | pizzeria.id | pizzeria.name | rating |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | Anna | 16 | female | Moscow | 1 | Pizza Hut | 4.6 |
| 1 | Anna | 16 | female | Moscow | 2 | Dominos | 4.3 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |


## Exercise 06
Let's return our mind back to exercise #03 and change our SQL statement to return person names instead of person identifiers and change ordering by action_date in ascending mode and then by person_name in descending mode. take a look at a data sample below.

| action_date | person_name |
| ------ | ------ |
| 2022-01-01 | Irina |
| 2022-01-01 | Anna |
| 2022-01-01 | Andrey |
| ... | ... |


## Exercise 07
write a SQL statement which returns the date of order from the `person_order` table and corresponding person name (name and age are formatted as in the data sample below) which made an order from the `person` table. Add a sort by both columns in ascending mode.

| order_date | person_information |
| ------ | ------ |
| 2022-01-01 | Andrey (age:21) |
| 2022-01-01 | Andrey (age:21) |
| 2022-01-01 | Anna (age:16) |
| ... | ... |


## Exercise 08
rewrite a SQL statement from exercise #07 by using NATURAL JOIN construction. The result must be the same like for exercise #07.  


## Exercise 09
write 2 SQL statements which return a list of pizzerias names which have not been visited by persons by using IN for 1st one and EXISTS for the 2nd one.


## Exercise 10
write a SQL statement which returns a list of the person names which made an order for pizza in the corresponding pizzeria. 
The sample result (with named columns) is provided below and yes ... please make ordering by 3 columns (`person_name`, `pizza_name`, `pizzeria_name`) in ascending mode.

| person_name | pizza_name | pizzeria_name | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Andrey | cheese pizza | Dominos |
| Andrey | mushroom pizza | Dominos |
| Anna | cheese pizza | Pizza Hut |
| ... | ... | ... |
